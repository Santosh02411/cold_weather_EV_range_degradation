"""
Routes for delivery records: create, update, list, delete, and role-specific
views (a dispatcher's full list vs. an agent's assigned-to-them list).

Every query in this file filters by `current_user.org_id` — this is what
makes multi-tenant isolation actually hold: two organizations sharing the
same deployment never see each other's deliveries, even though they're
all rows in the same physical `deliveries` table.

The offline sync flow (bulk upload with conflict resolution) lives
separately in routes/sync.py, since it has different logic (see
docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md).

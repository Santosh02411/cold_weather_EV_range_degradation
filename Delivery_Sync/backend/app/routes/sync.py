"""
The /sync endpoint — this is what the client calls when connectivity
returns, sending a batch of records that were saved offline in IndexedDB.

For each record, conflict resolution is applied (see services/conflict_resolver.py).
The response tells the client the FINAL state of each record, so the client
can update its local IndexedDB copy if the server's version won a conflict.

    Accepts a batch of offline records and resolves each one against the
    server's current state. Returns the final resolved version of every
    record so the client can reconcile its local IndexedDB copy.

    Each record is processed independently — same "one bad row shouldn't
    sink the whole batch" principle as bulk import. A record that fails
    (e.g. its agent_id doesn't match any real user) is reported in
    `errors` rather than aborting the request; it simply stays "pending"
    on the client and gets retried on the next sync attempt, so no data is
    lost, just delayed.

    Rate limited to 30 requests/minute per IP — generous enough for normal
    usage (the frontend auto-syncs at most every 15 seconds, i.e. 4/minute,
    plus occasional manual "Sync Now" clicks) while still capping abuse of
    this endpoint, which has no authentication.

"""
Email sending, abstracted behind one function so the rest of the app
never needs to know HOW an email actually gets delivered. Used for
password reset links and delivery status-change notifications.

This project has no budget for a paid transactional email service, so by
default, "sending" an email just prints it clearly to the backend
console/log instead of actually delivering it — which is enough to
develop and test the full flow (token generation and expiry for resets;
status text and tracking link for notifications) without needing any
external service at all.

If SMTP_HOST (and the other SMTP_* variables below) are set in the
environment, this switches to actually sending via any standard SMTP
server — for example, a free Gmail account with an "app password" works
here at zero cost. Nothing about the calling code changes based on which
path is used; only this module's internal behavior does.

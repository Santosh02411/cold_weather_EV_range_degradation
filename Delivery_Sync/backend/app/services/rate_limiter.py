"""
Shared Limiter instance. Defined in its own module (rather than directly
in main.py) so route files can import it and apply @limiter.limit(...) to
individual endpoints without a circular import (main.py imports the route
modules, so the route modules can't import the limiter back from main.py).

Storage backend: defaults to in-memory, which only tracks request counts
within a single running process — fine for this project's single-server
setup, but it would NOT coordinate limits correctly across multiple
server instances behind a load balancer (each instance would enforce its
own separate count). Setting the REDIS_URL environment variable switches
to a Redis-backed store instead, which every instance shares, making
rate limits consistent across a real multi-server deployment. This is
the standard fix for that gap — not implemented as "on" by default only
because it would otherwise require a Redis server to be running just to
start this project locally, which isn't needed for local development.

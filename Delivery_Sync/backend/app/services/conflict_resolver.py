    Browsers send timestamps like '2026-07-22T19:10:46.276Z', which Python
    parses as timezone-AWARE (they carry a 'this is UTC' marker). But
    SQLite/SQLAlchemy stores and returns timezone-NAIVE datetimes (no
    marker at all). Python refuses to compare aware and naive datetimes
    directly, which is exactly the bug this caused.

    Fix: always convert to UTC first (in case it wasn't already), then
    strip the timezone marker, so every datetime we compare or store is
    naive UTC consistently.
